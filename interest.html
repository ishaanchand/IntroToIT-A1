    <h2> What is my interest in IT? Particular event which sparked interest?</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout my childhood, I have always had a deep interest in all things technology. 
        My interest really began through my passion for video games and gaming consoles, the PlayStation to be specific. 
        Only around 18 months ago I became increasingly interested and intrigued in the sector of cyber security and artificial intelligence and their increasing importance in the global community. 
        Not much of an event but a person who has inspired me to pursue a career in the IT field would be my father, who has been involved in this sector for a better part of 20 years. 
        His knowledge and experience has been very important for me to choose this course and pursue a career in IT in the future.

    <h2>Why did you choose RMIT?</h2>
    <p>
        I chose RMIT University to undertake this course because I strongly believe they can help and challenge me to prepare adequately for a successful career in the IT sector.
         The electives and subjects which this course in particular has to offer also played a role in me choosing RMIT, 
         this being the opportunity to pursue my interest in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security to be particular.
 </p>
    <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
    <p>
        2 areas of information technology as I mentioned earlier which I’m really interested in are cyber security and artificial intelligence. 
        Hopefully during my tenure in RMIT, I can learn about the different applications of AI in our community as well as 
        educate and train myself to understand the importance of cyber security and its use as it continues to grow with a 
        vast majority of the population shifting to the digital or ‘cloud’ world. Down the line, I also want to be able to 
        incorporate my skills in the IT area with the more sales based/business sectors too, as this is something I feel
         will assist me a lot with career opportunities down the line.
