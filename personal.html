        Hello there! My name is Ishaan Chand and Iâ€™m currently a first year student at RMIT, studying Information Technology. 
        My student number at RMIT is s3899502 and my student email is s3899502@student.rmit.edu.au. 
        I was born in India on the 13th of July 2002 and moved to Australia at the beginning of 2010. 
        I attended Port Melbourne and Valkstone primary schools and finished my secondary education in Mckinnon Secondary College. 
        Some of my hobbies include playing cricket, reading books and listening to music (preferably hip-hop and rap!). 
        One interesting fact about me ( or my family) is that all 4 of us (myself, dad, mom and my sister) have 4 different last names!
