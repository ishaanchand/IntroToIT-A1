    <h4> What do these results mean?</h4>
    <p>
        The results of these tests showcase a variety of things. 
        One common pattern visible throughout the results is highlighting how I am an 
        introverted person who learns new things and topics through listening and being present
        in the environment which I am learning in. 
     </p>
    <h4> How would these results influence my behaviour on a team?	</h4>
    <p>
        To be very honest, I would have to change my approach to assignments 
        and tasks when working in groups rather than working individually. 
        I would have to be more open in order to listen to different perspectives 
        for the same topic and how I can use the information and knowledge gained 
        through the cooperation with peers in my own work.
    </p>
    <h4> How should I take this into account when forming a team?	</h4>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, there are some changes towards my learning and teamwork skills 
        which Iâ€™d have to implement on my behalf in order to successfully perform together 
        in a group in order to achieve a certain goal. All of the changes would have to be 
        enforced on my behalf rather than on the team.
