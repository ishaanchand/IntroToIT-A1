    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h2> Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    My project is based on an application or a website which is used for recruiting purposes, 
    mostly for students. This site will cover various parts of the recruitment sectors including 
    applicant or employee profiles, job advertisements in the area of the applicant as well as 
    having mini courses to direct the employee in regards to the type of knowledge they need to 
    have before applying for or entering a particular workplace. For example, if there was a job 
    position available at a liquor handling store, the applicant will have access to a mini 
    assessment / course module, which would give them an adequate amount of information, 
    training as well as a certification, declaring them fit for the role.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
    My main motivation behind this project is because it is so relatable to my current life as a uni student. 
    I strongly believe every student should have a part time job along with their studies so they get experience
     and exposure from a professional workplace before they try and pursue the career of their post graduation. 
     However, I also know the difficulties one could face when trying to apply for the job. Sometimes after 
     applying for a job, one might not hear from the employer ever again in regards to the application or 
     sometimes even if they are notified about their application, it is not the news which they were hoping for. 
     I believe there should be a platform where students from high school and universities are given more than 
     just a job title to find out what their role would consist of in order to prepare themselves better for their employment.
</p>

<h2> Project Description</h2>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p> The layout of the site would be similar to a recruiting website’s layout. Meaning, this would contain the following basic features;
  <p> > A toolbar at the top of the page where job types can be searched by keywords.</p>
  <p> > Applicants can enter what location they are after as well as choosing a certain radius to the location entered.</p> 
  <p> > Type of employment they are after, that being part time, casual, fixed term or full time.</p> 
  <p> > Classification of the workplace. This can be chosen from a drop down menu which would basically contain all the jobs available in each respective sector. Some options from the drop down menu can include education, hospitality, sales, trades & services, etc.</p> 
  <p> > There wouldn’t be an option to select the desired remuneration rate as this site is mostly targeted towards students and a large percentage of such jobs do not show the hourly rate on an advertisement, as it is usually discussed in an interview or induction. </p> 
</p>

<h2>Job advertisement example</h2>
<i> Team Member at Dan Murphy's Caroline Springs</i>
<p><b>Specific Requirments for the role;</b></p>
<p>> Over the age of 18</p>
<p>> Responsible service of Alcohol check (RSA)</p>

<p>Each applicant for the job must have a RSA as it is a legal document/training required by the Victorian Government. 
    The site will be able to guide the user to another page which will have exactly all the details required in order 
    to complete the RSA.
</p>
<P> Once the applicant has completed the RSA or any required course / certification (such as the working with children’s check) 
    all of their details will be linked to their account so it is easier for them to access all of their certificates 
    or work related documents such as resumes and cover letters, every time they are applying for a job.
</P>
<p>All employers will have similar questions in regards to one’s working rights or questions about their previous working experience. 
    All of these details will be pre-filled with the information provided by the user through their documents which they initially upload 
    to the site, so that this can improve the timeliness of the applications and be much more convenient for the user. 
</p>
<h2>Employer Page</h2>
<p> Another feature which I would like to include in the site would be for the employers themselves. 
    All employers through their sign in page will have access to the applicant’s profiles. 
    This way, the process of hiring the correct employee can be streamlined, saving the business valuable time and money. 
</p>
<p> Successful applicants will receive a message from the site in regards to their application which will have further details 
    in regards to their interview and the next steps. 
</p>
<p> Where does that leave the unsuccessful applicants? One common event across most recruitment firms is that the unsuccessful 
    applicants are left high and dry in regards to their application and are not sure of what is happening. 
    One of our main objectives is to make sure that the applicants are fully aware of each stage of the process. 
    This includes;
</p>
<p>> Notifying them when an application is submitted.</p>
<p>> Application has been opened and read by the employer. </p>
<p>> Notification message when either both successful or unsuccessful.</p>

<h2>Tools and Skills required</h2>
<p> A vast majority of tools and technologies used on this project would include web 
    development software such as HTML/CSS, Flash creator, Analytics tools. 
    Most of the focus would be in making sure that the site is easy to use for 
    both the applicant and the employer, including easy to use navigation and 
    information present on each page. The site itself in essence would be a large c
    entral database which holds all the key information of all the applicants required 
    by the employer. Hence expertise in the database area such as Microsoft Access or SQL 
    would also be required. As mentioned above, the majority of the skills would be required 
    in the HTML and CSS area of the site in ensuring that the site is aesthetic and easy to use.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p> If the site is successfully launched then I personally believe it can assist 
    a lot of people with their employment as well as firms with their recruitment. 
    People will have access to all the relevant jobs according to their needs and 
    if required will have the right accreditation for the role too. The process of 
    recruitment can be an arduous one for most businesses without a large recruiting budget. 
    The site should be able to successfully assist employers in choosing the right worker for 
    their firm by showing them all the relevant details about the applicants.
