    <p>
        The job, as shown in the above snapshot, is of an Enterprise Account Executive role. 
        The client of the firm offer a range of IT services for their customers including services in cloud migration,
         cyber security and managing services. What makes this position really appealing to me is the combination 
         of the sales and IT sectors. I believe every company should have the ability to sell its services/products 
         to its customers and along with a combination of my interests in IT make this a very fascinating role.

        This job would require a substantial amount of experience in a similar field before stepping into this role. 
        Skills required for the role would include organisational skills, communication and teamwork skills as well 
        as strong leadership skills. Building new relationships with the client as well as utilising previous relationships 
        would also be key to successfully perform in this role. Since the client of the firm is involved in the IT sector, 
        a strong understanding of information technology and the clientâ€™s needs would also be important.

        A vast majority of the skills mentioned above, I would be covering in my uni course. 
        This would mostly involve the actual knowledge about the IT services including cyber security and cloud management. 
        Skills such as organisational skills, teamwork and communication skills can be developed through participating 
        in multiple group projects / assignments to perform or achieve a certain task. Working in teams allows you to 
        be exposed to different ideas and viewpoints towards the same problem, which would almost certainly broaden your 
        understanding about the topic or task.
